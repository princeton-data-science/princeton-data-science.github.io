<h2><em>What is a data science internship in Silicon Valley like?</em></h2>

<p>I finished my summer internship at Opower a few weeks ago, where I was an engineering intern on the Data Science team. Opower is a tech company that works with utilities to encourage consumers to save energy through behavioral science. Its headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia, where there about 400 employees, and the second office is located in San Francisco, where there are about 200. Opower filed for an IPO in 2014, so I would call it a small-midsize company as opposed to a startup. </p>

    <center><img style="middle;width:50%;height:50%" src="/anna2.jpg"></center>
</div>

<p>When I accepted the offer to work at Opower, it was mid-January and I had just finished taking my last final. I had applied to a program called <a href="http://kpcbfellows.com/">KPCB Fellows</a>, 
<span style="color:green">APPLY!!!</span>) with a tip from a friend who was a Fellow last year, and I knew it would be an exciting summer. So, I took the plunge.</p>

<h2><strong>Location</strong></h2>

<p>San Francisco, tech capital of the world. I had been to SF before for 5 days through an amazing program called <a href="http://squareup.com/code-camp/college">Square College Code Camp for women in engineering</a>, <span style="color:green">APPLY!!!</span>) but I had done little sightseeing and I didn’t feel like I knew the city at all. My first big challenge before starting was finding a place to live, which required me to learn all the neighborhoods and their respective vibes. The Opower office was in South of Market (SOMA), a neighborhood densely packed with startup offices. I knew that I wanted to live in the Mission, which is full of energy and young professionals. However, the Mission is also the ultimate example of skyrocketing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/us/high-rents-elbow-latinos-from-san-franciscos-mission-district.html">SF rent and gentrification</a>. It took me months of searching, but I finally managed to find an apartment that I could afford. Last summer, I stayed in NJ, so living on my own on the other side of the country was an exciting prospect!</p>

<div style="float:middle;width:50%;height:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
    <center><img style="text-align:right;width:50%;height:50%" src="/anna3.jpg"></center>
</div>

<p>I believe that a summer in SF is really what you make of it. My friends and I took full advantage of what the city and the Bay Area had to offer: outings to Dolores Park, free concerts, Muir Woods, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, food festivals, visits to Berkeley and Stanford, Sunday evenings on the beach, and numerous free events for tech interns (dinner was often free through one event or another). There are endless ways to meet new, extremely interesting people. I made a point of walking to places whenever I could so that, by the end, I felt like I could find my way anywhere.</p>

<h2><strong>Office Space</strong></h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed about Opower was the office, which had an open floor plan. This is pretty common in SF and Silicon Valley in general. Coming in, I didn’t expect to like the open floor plan because of the lack of privacy. I also noticed that the floor was completely lined with these massive windows that let in copious amounts of sunlight. That was a huge plus. Also, it aligned with Opower’s mission of energy efficiency. There was a hum around the office- people were definitely working and not just hanging out. Yet there was still lots of evidence that people liked to have fun; the ironic Justin Bieber cardboard cutout in one pod or the comprehensive collection of Keanu Reeves posters by mine. There were happy hours on Fridays. However, I haven’t yet mentioned the #1 perk of the Opower office: the kitchen.</p>

<p>I’ll try to contain my excitement about the Opower kitchen. Food is a priority at Opower, which makes it my kind of company. For breakfast, I would get yogurt from one of the fridges, cut up a banana, pour in a granola from Berkeley that has ruined granola for me because it’s just so good, and sprinkle in some fresh blueberries. There was always a variety of snacks and instant meals, plus a fridge of drinks, but what really made the kitchen special was that it had all the supplies for a lunch. If you wanted, you could grab some salad mix, fresh vegetables, toast bread with cheese and cold cuts, and have yourself a deliciously fresh lunch. The kitchen was also a watering hole where you could catch up with people you didn’t see around your pod, etc.</p>

<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>

<p>I absolutely loved the people I worked with. The people you’re around for 80% of the workday are pretty integral to the work experience, and I definitely lucked out. The Data Science team was about 6 strong, and we were also positioned next to the Data Services team. I was constantly amazed by how knowledgeable, resourceful, and funny my coworkers were. My mentor checked in with me often to make sure that I was keeping up and that I wasn’t out of work. Because of the open office, I felt comfortable just turning around and asking my team a question whenever I needed- and if the person wasn’t there, I would just toss it onto the Slack (group messaging platform) and wait for someone to address it. My pod-mates mostly had computer science degrees and engineering backgrounds, ranging from undergrad to PhD. We went out to lunch together often and engaged in an extremely intense fitness competition via Fitbit. Not to brag or anything, but our team was so cool that management took notice and got the entire office Fitbits.</p>

<h2><strong>The work itself</strong></h2>

<p>By now, you’re probably wondering if I did any work at all this summer. I was at Opower for 10 weeks and I completed two projects that each spanned five. The first project was more research/exploration and the second was direct work with production code that the entire team was writing and reviewing.</p>

<p><strong>Project 1: See if consumer opt-out from Opower’s reports can be explained through demographic factors with a logistic regression first on a small scale and then larger scale.</strong></p>

<p><em><p>Tools/languages: Databricks (hosted cloud service for big data), Pandas, Apache Spark, MLlib, SQL, IPython notebooks/Python</p></em></p>

<p>What was most interesting/challenging: I actually hadn’t coded in Python before coming to Opower, so I learned a new language and a bunch of libraries specifically for data science and machine learning. I learned about precision recall curves as a measure of model strength and how computing clusters handle big jobs. </p>

<p>What was most frustrating: Not understanding what the libraries actually did under the hood. A lot of wrangling with Apache Spark syntax. Most of all, even though the data was straight from utilities, it still had plenty of issues. Data science is honestly not that glamorous most of the time. It is true that 50-80% of time is spent just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html">cleaning the data or finding gaps in it and deciding how to move forward </a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who did I work with:</strong> Occasionally got help from other members of the team but mostly just my mentor.</p>

<p><strong>Project 2: Coding up an optimization model for energy disaggregation and unit tests</strong></p>

<p><em><p>Tools/languages: Java, Jenkins, GitHub</em></p></p>

<p>What was most interesting/challenging: doing math on a whiteboard with my mentor and getting to the correct expressions mathematically before putting them into code form! I felt like Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting even though I was totally helpless most of the time and my mentor was guiding me through it. I was so excited that classes like multi-variable calc, linear algebra, and even ORF 307 were useful.</p>

<p>What was most frustrating: Every time I thought I was done- whether it was with the code for the optimizers or the documentation for it, there was always a way to improve or refactor just a bit. Every time our engineering lead commented to let me know that there was still work to do, my heart sank a little. Work projects are very different from school assignments. When you’re at school, you know that you’re done as soon as the deadline passes. At work, you need to submit code that is living and breathing, that other people will likely change and improve. Readability is important to get a good grade at school, but at work it’s possibly even more important than the code itself.</p> 

<p><strong>Who did I work with:</strong> entire team, especially our Engineering Lead because he was reviewing my code.</p>

<p>I learned about Scrum and other strategies for productivity. In particular, I liked that my team had a daily standup meeting every morning to ensure that everyone was on the same page. Everything was transparent- if anyone was having problems, it was completely natural to admit it and ask for help. I also enjoyed that I could work from home, so if I was feeling productive on a weekday evening I could log some hours and then skip a few later that week if I needed to attend an event.</p>

<h2><strong>KPCB</strong></h2>

<p>Kleiner Perkins Caulfield Byers is an established venture capital fund located in Menlo Park, CA. Being a KPCB Fellow was a truly incredible “in” to the Silicon Valley community, startups, and venture capital. There were about 80 other fellows in the program- most were engineering, a few were product management, and a few were design. The fellows were from all over the country- Princeton had five. There were some international fellows as well. The events started with a welcome reception in late June and ended in early August with a kayaking day trip- we had approximately 2-3 events a week. We had the incredible chance to do a roundtable with John Doerr, a renowned venture capitalist (VC) and a partner at KPCB. We heard from Uber CPO Jeff Holden about how he makes important career decisions. The events were always super efficient-- buses everywhere-- and really fostered a sense of community between fellows. One of my favorite moments during the summer was when I was just walking down Market Street after work and I bumped into another fellow- we recognized each other because we were both wearing KPCB jackets, and I joined him on a UNIQLO expedition for pants.</p>

<p>Honestly, my experience as a data science intern day-to-day was very similar to that of a software engineering intern. The tools we use are perhaps a bit different, though often the same. Also, I’m sure that there are different kinds of data science internships in SF- some that are more academic and mathy, and some that are more like mine. I did do some math at times, but it wasn’t like my mentor and I spent weeks deciding what models to use, or developing new ones. </p>

<p>I still think data science is cool even after a summer of working in it, so that seems to be a good sign. There is a lot of muck and cleaning, but my favorite part is the search for some golden nugget of insight. When I finally get a meaningful coefficient as an output, or better yet, find a graph that just instantly grabs people with its visual story, that is when I feel that data science is the coolest industry out there. Until next time, Princeton Data Science!</p>
